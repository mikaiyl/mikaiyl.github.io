# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project aims to create a professional, ATS (Applicant Tracking System) compliant resume website that can be deployed to GitHub Pages. The site will use a simple tech stack consisting of HTML, CSS, and TailwindCSS with a build process to generate optimized static assets. The primary focus is on creating a resume that is both visually appealing to human readers and easily parseable by automated systems used in recruitment processes.
